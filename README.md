ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Andres an NLP Engineer and Erasmus Mundus recipient currently pursuing an M.Sc in NLP and AI in Malta and France!

- I love solving challengues whenever I can, especially multimodal ones (i.e. image to text and speech synthesis). I have experience as a data scientist and I'm a hobby musician!

ðŸ“« You can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Zappangon), but I mostly use it as a learning platform... If you really want to get in touch, you can pm on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-gonzalez-gongora-4b428613b/).

I hope you have a lovely day or evening wherever you are and happy learning!
