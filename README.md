ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Andres an NLP and ML Engineer currently working at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center on climate models and NLP for climate.

- I love solving challengues whenever I can, especially multimodal ones (i.e. image to text and speech synthesis). I have experience as a data scientist and I'm a hobby musician!
