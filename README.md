👋 Hello, I’m Andres an NLP Engineer and Erasmus Mundus recipient currently pursuing an M.Sc in NLP and AI in Malta and France!

- I love solving challengues whenever I can, especially multimodal ones (i.e. image to text and speech synthesis). I have experience as a data scientist and I'm a hobby musician!

👀 I’m interested in practical projects, especially in low-resourced languages.

- In our field, it seems that we've left some languages such as Maltese to their own devices. I love exploring solutions that leverage current architectures for these languages.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about knowledge base discovery and hoping to merge it with my current skill set.

- I love exploring tools and mathematical concepts with languages like R and Julia! I try to update my repositories with projects that I've pursued and I'm really hoping that I can start adding some work I've done with Julia. It's an amazing language, try it out!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on VQA and speech synthesis.

- I'm in general down with whatever NLP-related project comes your way, so don't hesitate to contact me.

📫 You can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Zappangon), but I mostly use it as a learning platform... If you really want to get in touch, you can pm on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-gonzalez-gongora-4b428613b/).

I hope you have a lovely day or evening wherever you are and happy learning!
